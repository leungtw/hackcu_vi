# HackCU VI
## Job Tracker

Dependencies:
* pymongo
* flask

### To run this application, the following is required:

`python -m pip install flask`
`python -m pip install pymongo`
`pip install requests`
`pip install beautifulsoup4`

If your venv cannot find one of the modules, try:
`sudo apt install python[version#]-flask`
`sudo apt install python[version#]-pymongo`
Usage ex:
`sudo apt install python3-flask`

Since the main() function has all of the flask declarations self contained, it should be able to be ran by simply:
`python app.py`
